The chomre interepreter:

part 1
- user enters natural language input for a proposed program
- llm agents devise uml architecture consisting of data structures, interfaces, and functions for the program

part 2

- agents write code that fleshes out the chom tree, recursively building on it
    - agent will create directories and files as needed.

part 3
